108 is a game similar to the well-known UNO. However, this is the game I grew up learning in Mongolia. A lot of Mongolian children play this game with a regular set of cards.  

Similarly to UNO, your goal is to try to get rid of as many of your cards as you can (all of it if you can). However, in 108, you mark how many cards you have left at the end of the round (when someone finishes all their cards). 2-6s aren't included in the deck, Jacks are worth 2 and Kings are worth 4. Aces are worth 11 and Queens are worth 30 points. Everything else is face value. Aces skip. 7s make the next player draw 3. Queens is a wild card. Once a player reaches over 108 points at the end of a round, they are out of the game. If you end with 108 points exactly, your points will be divided in half. You cannot end on a 7, or you will be forced to draw. If you end with a Queen, your points will be subtracted by 30. 

You can play this game on replit.

Enter your name, input how many CPU players you want to play against, then begin the game. D to draw or type in the card you want to use from your hand (i.e. S2 for 2 of Spades).

Hope you enjoy! I appreciate any comments on feedback.
