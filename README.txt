108 is a game similar to the well-known UNO. However, this is the game I grew up learning in Mongolia. A lot of Mongolian children play this game with a regular set of cards.  

Similarly to UNO, your goal is to try to get rid of as many of your cards as you can (all of it if you can). However, in 108, you mark how many cards you have left at the end of the round (when someone finishes all their cards). 2s and 3s don't count to points, Jacks and Kings are worth 10. Aces are worth 11 and Queens are worth 13 points. Everything else is face value. Once a player reaches 108 points at the end of a round, they are out of the game. Also, you are not allowed to end a round on a Queen card. 

To play this terminal game, colorama is needed. Type "pip install colorama" in your command line.

Once you download the files, start the main.py file. Enter your name, input how many CPU players you want to play against, then begin the game. D to draw or type in the card you want to use from your hand (i.e. S2 for 2 of Spades).

Hope you enjoy!
