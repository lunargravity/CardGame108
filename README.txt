108 is a game similar to the well-known UNO. Similarly, your goal is to try to get rid of as many of your cards as you can (all of it if you can). However, in 108, you mark how many cards you have left at the end of the round (when someone finishes all their cards). 2s and 3s don't count to points, but other number cards are worth the same number of points as they are while letter cards are worth 10 with ace being 11.
